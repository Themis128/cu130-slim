# BACKLOG (living)

## Done 2026-10-25

## Leftovers (human gates)
- X re-auth: click x-reconnect.sh output URL (works — verified live)
- LinkedIn password + li_at rotation (exposed earlier in session)
- Community Management API: dedicated 2nd app dev-portal submission
- 2 live posts link cloudless.com not .gr — delete+recreate awaiting go-ahead (fb 7c7948a4, li bd301640)
- Threads business profile: browser-session edits (bio/name) — threads-ops scripts ready
- Stacked-branch conflicts recur — prefer fresh-off-master topic branches

## 2026-10-27 — X OAuth1 fallback + PR sweep

- TwitterAPIClient now retries 401/403 via OAuth1Session (user-context) — fixes dead OAuth2 grant when the secret rotates. Wired through `_send` on all 12 call sites; `x_tool.py` routes through it too. Verified live: `validate_token` returns `@TBaltzakis` (id 2046380838477041664).
- 30 PRs → auto-merge queued; 13 conflicting branches rebased + pushed; merge queue drains via CI.
- `feat/phone-tiktok-skills` (PR #941): phone MCP + TikTok resubmit/IG/X scripts — pending CI.
- Slack sweep: alerts are transient worker timeouts (recovered); 2 engagement-gate reposts pending manual review by design.
- Still open: TikTok verification (sidecar login or manual Edit); engagement-gate repost approvals; real X creds if OAuth2 reauth is wanted later (OAuth1 covers posting/DM now).
